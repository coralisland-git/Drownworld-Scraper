For those who are shooting less off-the-cuff footage and want complete control, manual control of exposure is also available. Audio for video is recorded using three microphones. In normal conditions, the HERO5 Black will process the audio for a stereo signal. If high winds start affecting the audio, the HERO5 Black can intuit which microphone is picking up the best sound and automatically switch to that microphone in real-time and filter out any excess wind noise. While the audio will only be in mono, you will know that you’re getting the highest possible audio quality. Photo Modes Raw File Option: In addition to standard JPEG capture, the HERO5 Black can also capture raw images in the .GPR format. Raw images offer enthusiasts or professional photographers more flexibility after the photo is taken. Raw images can be processed after-the-fact for higher quality output. WDR Mode: Bridging the gap between JPEG capture and raw, the WDR (Wide Dynamic Range) mode is also available. If the scene has dark shadows and bright highlights, WDR mode will retain better detail in those areas. Burst Mode: Bursts of photos can be taken during high-action sequences to ensure that you capture the moment. The camera’s buffer can fit up to 30 photos from a single burst, and burst durations can be set from six seconds to one second, effectively offering a 30fps burst of 12MP photos. Time Lapse Mode: Record clouds floating by, traffic snaking through cityscapes, or stars and constellations tracing their way across the sky with the time lapse mode. Set your interval from a picture every 1/2 second to every minute for different effects. Wireless and Mobile Device Connectivity Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity enable the HERO5 Black to interface with mobile devices and wireless accessories. Free apps from GoPro, CAPTURE and QUIK fully integrate the functionality of your HERO5 Black with your mobile device. CAPTURE offers live preview, playback, and full camera control over Wi-Fi. QUIK is a quick editing platform for easy trimming and sharing of your recorded videos.",

It is designed from the ground up to work seamlessly with the DJI GO/DJI GO 4 app, giving camera operators total control.","Product Description ULTRA-BRIGHT A maximum 2000 cd/m² of brightness means the CrystalSky monitor is more than four times as bright as typical mobile devices. On-screen details are clear and sharp, and colors are vibrant, giving the quality needed to fine tune image composition. A dedicated Sunlight Readability Enhancement mode is especially designed for processing the image in real-time to ensure more comfortable viewing under bright light. 7.85” Ultra Bright 2000 cd/m² Resolution: 2048×1536 (7.85”) SMOOTHER VIDEO DISPLAY The CrystalSky monitor uses optimized video decoding to decode video in real-time. Due to limitations in software access on smartphones and tablets, video decoding in other smart devices is less than ideal. When used to view photos or videos transmitted by the camera, problems can occur including video jitter, long latency and more. The CrystalSky monitor’s optimized decoder provides smooth, real-time video with minimal latency. CUSTOMIZED SYSTEM AND DJI GO/DJI GO 4 A newly designed system removes unnecessary Android apps and services and is resistant to viruses and junk software. This ensures that the CrystalSky monitor is able to offer optimum performance at all times. Its embedded DJI GO/DJI GO 4 app provides full access to all DJI GO/DJI GO 4 features including aircraft parameter adjustment, camera control, footage management, and playback. Using offline maps, maps can be kept available even if going out of Wi-Fi reach. POWER SUPPLY A two cell 4920 mAh secondary external battery gives the CrystalSky monitor a longer operating time than comparable mobile devices. It supports quick charge, and controls its discharge rate well even in low temperatures. Used with the 7.85″ and 5.5″ screens, it can achieve a maximum operation time of 4-5 hours and 5-6 hours respectively. DUAL SD CARD SLOTS Equipped with dual Micro SD Card slots, the CrystalSky monitor’s storage can be extended, or footage recorded on a Micro SD Card can be played back directly on the monitor. It can also be used for footage backups. Using editors built in DJI GO/DJI GO 4, high-quality edits can be made quickly and instantly shared to social media. The CrystalSky monitor supports H.264 and H.265 video decoding, allowing it to play back these files at 30 fps and 60 fps respectively. These videos can also be output through its HDMI port. PORTS AND NETWORK The CrystalSky monitor’s HDMI port allows up to 4K video to be output to FPV goggles and other display devices. Built-in dual band Wi-Fi means it can connect to Wi-Fi networks and Wi-Fi hotspots from mobile devices, and it is also compatible with 4G dongles and USB storage through its USB-A port. When connected to the internet, the CrystalSky monitor gets easy access to system upgrades, livestreaming, photo or video sharing, data synchronization and more. File sizes are optimized as much as possible to minimize mobile data demands. Onboard Micro USB and USB-C ports make it convenient to connect the CrystalSky monitor with a remote controller or other device s.

Why does DJI have refurbished drones? Example: If a customer receives a new drone and it has a manufacturing fault, it is replaced with a new drone, [DJI warranty is only valid in South Africa if purchased through a DJI authorised South African dealer.]and the faulty drone sent straight back to the factory, where the faulty component of the original drone is replaced by DJI, it is then sold as refurbished. Are DJI refurbished products quality guaranteed? Before a refurbished DJI drone leaves the factory, it undergoes a rigorous refurbishment process to make sure it’s up to DJI’s high standards. It is backed with DJI’s one-year warranty – exactly the same as a brand new drone.DJI promises you that every refurbished product is tested thoroughly and that the quality and the appearance of refurbished products is the same as with their new products. What kind of after-sale service are DJI refurbished products eligible for? The after-sale service policy for DJI refurbished products is identical to that of new products . However, refurbished products can only be exchanged for refurbished products, not new products.Please note that the DJI warranty is only valid in South Africa if purchased through a DJI authorised South African dealer.","Product Description Direct From DJI, Refurb with Full 12 Month SA Support & Warranty [distinguish this from new and we will swap it for a new drone] AERODYNAMIC, TRANSFORMING DESIGN Carbon fiber arms give you the strength to maneuver in the air and they transform, moving out of the camera’s way at the flick of a switch. With a full 360⁰ unobstructed view, you now have the freedom to capture shots independent of the direction you are flying. ROTOR DESIGN The all new 13 inch quick release rotors are built with the unique DJI “Z-Blade” design. They have been reinforced with a new carbon fiber compound material to ensure excellent performance with increased stability. CURVED MAGNETS Brushless motors pioneered by DJI are now the standard in the multirotor industry. But the Inspire 1 takes the next step in brushless development by integrating curved magnets that fit flush around the edge of each motor. Although much more difficult to produce, these magnets eliminate airflow gaps within the motor, greatly increasing efficiency. SINGLE-WIRE DESIGN Several strands of copper wire have been replaced by a single, dense strand. Reducing the wasted space between wires results in more copper within each motor, providing more power and less resistance. A centrifugal pump increases airflow inside the neat, tight copper windings dissipating heat much faster while greatly increasing the life of the motors. INTELLIGENT POWER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM A fully integrated intelligent battery powers your Inspire 1 and virtually manages itself. When in flight, your remaining battery power is shown live, letting you know how long you can continue to fly. Advanced algorithms calculate the distance of your aircraft and estimated time to return home, letting you know when it’s time to fly back. The battery reports the voltage of each cell, the total lifetime charges and discharges, and the overall health and battery status. All this helps you keep your Inspire 1 in the air and flying for years to come. POSITIONING As it flies, the position of your Inspire 1 is constantly updated and recorded using a high-strength, intelligent GLONASS + GPS system. This dual positioning system enables higher precision and quicker satellite acquisition, allowing you to see where the aircraft is on a live map and giving it a point to hover at when you release the controls. MAIN CONTROLLER This is the “brain” of the entire system, receiving thousands of bits of data every second and translating that data into action as you fly. The Main Controller tells every part of your Inspire 1 what to do, calculates environmental conditions in real-time, and ensures that the aircraft responds to your control commands instantly. IMU Automatically keeping the Inspire 1 stable and steady during flight only looks easy, as DJI’s advanced Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) handles everything. The IMU incorporates both a 6-axis gyroscope and an accelerometer to monitor miniscule changes in tilt and movement. This allows the aircraft to compensate and adjust immediately, holding its position at all times. FAILSAFE All of these features combine to put your Inspire 1 on autopilot when needed. If the battery runs low or connection with your remote controller is lost, the Inspire 1 uses its positioning system and smart flight technology to return back to you. HOVER IN PLACE WITHOUT GPS You can take off and land at the press of a button and keep your Inspire 1 steady indoors or when GPS satellites can’t be acquired with the new DJI Vision Positioning System. COMBINED VISUAL DATA AND SONAR WAVES DJI built the Vision Positioning System from the ground up, customizing it to meet the rigorous requirements in place for anything that handles position holding on our flying platforms. This system combines visual data and sonar waves in a single unit, detecting both variance in patterns on the ground and current altitude. With this information, your Inspire 1 can hover in place and automatically raise or lower its arms as you liftoff or descend to the ground. THE CPU CHIP But the sonar and visual information is just one half of the fully integrated package: processing this information is handled by a dedicated CPU chip. This chip takes in feedback and outputs data in real-time, and is intelligent enough to distinguish between objects and ground patterns. All of this data is given to your Inspire 1’s flight controller, which in turn communicates with the entire aircraft. Remote controller included. Unobstructed, free of interference, with remote controller when FCC compliant.Maximum flight distance in SA 3.5km. The FCC compliant range only applies in America while in most of the world the drones are forced to be CE (Central European) compliant, this means that when a drone automatically detects its location, it will adjust its transmitter power accordingly.

AUTOMATIC FLIGHT ASSISTANT Fly with absolute freedom and confidence, knowing your Phantom 3 Standard will return to you at the press of a button. Built-in GPS records your Phantom’s takeoff point and remembers it as you fly. Then at your command, or if the control signal is ever lost, your Phantom comes back to you instantly. Your Phantom 3 Standard stays stable and under your control at all times during flight. After takeoff, it automatically hovers in place, waiting for your command. It then effortlessly changes altitude or direction at the flick of a finger. When you want it to stop, it again pauses and hovers, waiting for your next instruction. EASY, ASSISTED FLIGHT Flying a Phantom 3 Standard is easy. The first time and every time. Your Phantom automatically keeps itself in the air, level and steady. Flying has never been this easy. AUTO-HOVER When you stop telling it to move, the Phantom 3 Standard hovers perfectly in place, holding both position and altitude. It waits for you to give it instructions. This means all you need to think about is where you want to fly. SAFE FLIGHT LIMITS Set height and distance limits to keep all flights within a safe area. The Phantom 3 Standard will automatically stop and stay inside of your chosen limits as you fly. LIVE GPS Throughout each flight, your Phantom 3 Standard sends its position to a live GPS map on your mobile device. Use this map to see right where it is, know which direction it is facing, and guide it back to you in an instant. Because the Phantom knows where it is and where you are, it can calculate how much longer it can continue flying. It will send you a reminder to land when the battery runs low, and it can automatically come home and land when needed. WORRY-FREE, EVERY TIME When you are flying, you always know where your Phantom is, and it is always ready to come back to you. With built-in Return to Home, the Phantom 3 Standard remembers where you took off from and comes back when you are finished flying. So enjoy your flight, tap a button, and your Phantom is back in your hands, safe and secure. STATUS AND DIRECTION INDICATORS Four bright, large LED lights on each arm of the Phantom 3 Standard light up as you fly. So at a glance, you know which direction your Phantom is facing and its current status. YOUR FLYING CAMERA Record moments that you want to remember forever, and share those moments in an unforgettable way. The Phantom 3 Standard gives you an all  new perspective of sports, parties, and family events with a built-in camera that captures sharp, vivid 2.7K HD video and 12 megapixel photos. Shaky photos and video can ruin even the most impressive scenes. Keeping the camera perfectly stable is a precision engineered 3-axis gimbal, giving your footage a little movie magic. As the Phantom tilts and turns, the gimbal holds the camera flat and level, eliminating all unwanted shake. YOUR FLYING CAMERA Putting a camera in the sky makes everything you capture more exciting and fun to watch. Take unbelievable photos, shoot videos of friends and family, and record life’s moments in ways you never thought possible. With the Phantom 3 Standard, share your aerial photos and videos instantly to your favorite social networks and amaze your friends. STUNNING PHOTOS AND VIDEO The built in camera shoots 2.7K video, which is almost 3 times as clear as the picture on your HD TV, at 30 frames per second and a maximum of 40 Mbps. Or record in full 1080P HD to capture every frame and never miss a moment. Photos from the Phantom 3 Standard come out in 12 megapixel JPEG or DNG RAW format that look as great printed out as they do on the screen. A 1/2.3” sensor, fast f/2.8 prime lens, and a preset focus are all optimized for aerial images that give you awe-inspiring results. CLEAN, ACCURATE IMAGES Most flying cameras suffer from a distorted, or “fisheye”, image. The Phantom 3 Standard is equipped with a custom built lens with a 94⁰ field of view that gives you a perfect image that is nearly distortion-free and a more accurate depiction of the world below. MOVIE-QUALITY STABILIZATION Keeping the camera stable and shake-free is crucial to creating beautiful images, whether on the ground or in the air. This is why a good stabilization gimbal is so important. The 3-axis gimbal that holds the camera on your Phantom 3 Standard is evolved from the same technology found in high-end equipment that is relied on by Hollywood filmmakers and gives you stable footage every time. The Phantom 3 standard naturally banks and rolls as you fly, but the gimbal responds instantly and keeps the camera perfectly level. So your photos look sharp and your videos stay smooth, no matter how you fly. INTUITIVE, POWERFUL FLIGHT Enjoy the thrill of flight as you speed through the air. Powerful, responsive motors send your Phantom soaring exactly on the path you want. Stop in place, speed up, or fly higher in an instant. Curved DJI electromagnets are used to spin the motors at high, controllable speeds – all by using magnetic force, without any physical contact, to increase durability. Advances in efficiency and reliability push the limits of current technology and give you longer flights. ULTIMATE CONTROL Full control is in your hands with a remote controller built specifically for the Phantom 3 Standard. Precise control sticks command flight, while a dial lets you tilt the camera to see more. With a built-in rechargeable battery, a clamp to hold your mobile device, and a range extender for up to 0.62 mile (1km) range, this powerful remote makes flying easy and fun. FLIGHT MADE EASY A custom-built remote controller keeps your Phantom 3 Standard under your command at all times. The ergonomic design is easy to hold and lightweight, and all the controls you need are right at your fingertips. With this remote, it’s easy to fly the way you want. TILT THE CAMERA Aim the camera by using the gimbal control dial on top of the remote. Tilt it up and down to see more and frame the perfect shot. PRECISION CONTROL Easy to grip control sticks enable accurate, precise flight. Everything from minute position adjustments to full speed flying is instant and intuitive. These spring-loaded sticks automatically center when you let go, freezing the Phantom in place. So you can frame your shot, check the map, and plan your next move while it hovers and waits. BUILT-IN WIFI Linking your mobile device to your Phantom through the DJI GO app is easy with an enhanced WiFi range extender that’s built right into the remote controller.

LONG FLIGHTS, LONG LIFE For ease of use, a rechargeable 2600 mAh LiPo battery is integrated into the remote controller.

Features The first drone with a brain, Solo is powered by twin computers Only drone to stream live HD video from GoPro direct to iOS/Android devices Revolutionary, intuitive video game-style controller Take to the air in seconds with effortless pushbutton flight Powerful Smart Shot technology makes capturing incredible cinematic footage easy and automatic Unique safety features like pause and “safety net” mean you can fly with confidence First with in-flight GoPro access: Start/stop recording and adjust camera settings from the ground (with Solo Gimbal) Full-featured app for iOS and Android puts total craft control at your fingertips Follow Me mode enables Solo to automatically track and film any subject Solo Gimbal delivers smooth footage, GoPro power and control and HDMI video Future-proof accessory and gimbal bays make Solo ready for tomorrow’s technology Free software and feature updates ensure your Solo evolves at the pace of innovation The smart drone keeps getting smarter: LiDAR for super stable indoor flight; ballistic parachute system; flight rewind and more, all scheduled for release Includes 2 Spare Propellors When Solo was created the intention was not to create  just the best drone, but the best aerial photography experience imaginable.  You get the shot, every time. What makes the Solo smart? Not only does Solo have the world’s most advanced Pixhawk 2 autopilot system, but it also runs two 1 GHz computers, one on the copter and one in the controller, connected via a powerful dedicated Wi-Fi signal carried by 3DR Link. This processing power enables Solo to do amazing things that no personal drone has ever been able to do. You can think of these computers as Solo’s “frontal cortex”—the most advanced part of the brain. They handle all of Solo’s high-level functions, like Smart Shots, HD video transmission and exclusive GoPro control features. The autopilot—traditionally a drone’s only nerve center—now works sort of like Solo’s “brain stem,” responsible solely for the basic rudiments of flight. By splitting up the work like this, Solo dramatically reduces the likelihood of mechanical failure in flight and opens up a world of possibility for adding advanced capabilities and features. Solo’s intelligence makes it possible for beginners and pros alike to capture professional-grade shots from day one. Its powerful and one-of-a-kind computer-assisted Smart Shots allow you to set up the exact shot you want, then let Solo execute the shot with the precision of a seasoned cinematographer; and with a list of Smart Shots to choose from, the perfect shot is always just a few taps away. Solo is also the first all-in-one drone to offer live streaming of HD video from your GoPro directly to your mobile device, as well as built-in HDMI for live broadcast in HD. Cablecam: Lock Solo onto a virtual cable between any two points in space. Now you can freely pan and tilt the camera on your known-safe flight path, or let Solo memorize your first and last frames and smoothly pan the camera between them for you—all you have to do is tap “play.” Orbit: Solo can automatically circle any subject of your choosing, keeping it perfectly framed to capture an iconic “wrap-around” shot. Adjust the circle’s radius to get the exact shot you want, even midflight. Selfie: With one touch Solo will fly up and away from you, keeping the camera centered on you so the scenery around you expands in a dramatic aerial pullout shot. Then Solo will reverse that shot as it comes back to you, landing right where it took off. Follow Me: Go completely hands-free! Solo can follow wherever you go, automatically keeping the camera on you to capture your every move. Other cool features: A new ergonomic controller built specifically for aerial photography. Its video game-style design breaks from the clunky and complicated RC tradition, so it feels familiar to even new pilots. And in keeping with the video game theme, the controller has a pause button—an airbrake you can hit at any time to stop Solo midflight. A full-featured mobile app for both iOS and Android. Choose between a live view from the camera or a satellite view of your selected shot, control your GoPro, and even change how the controller responds to commands. Add the Solo Gimbal and get stabilized cinematic video; full access to GoPro controls; stream HD video to your mobile device; even power your GoPro while you fly. Solo is built to evolve: gimbal bay, accessory bay and swappable motor pods for easily integrating new technology and features as they’re invented. Your Solo won’t be obsolete in a year. What new technology? Everything from new flight modes and features to first-party accessories, third-party accessories, and new gimbals and accessories. Solo’s computers make flying easy for beginners and pros alike. Smooth and powerful satellite-guided flight ensures Solo’s position is always accurate, and Smart Shot modes keep Solo locked onto predetermined flight paths. It’s also got that great new video game-style controller for a feel that’s reassuring to any user. Plus the controller features one-button flight controls: Take off, land and return home automatically. And if you panic, don’t worry: There’s the pause button. Solo is built to maximise the GoPro experience. Working closely with GoPro in order to give you the best aerial photography experience imaginable. This is the world’s first gimbal that offers direct in-flight access to the GoPro controls: With just a click of a button on the controller, you can now start and stop recording and snap the exact photos you want during your flight—or change the GoPro settings from within our mobile app. Additionally, Solo is the world’s first drone that offers plug-and-play live streaming HD video from your GoPro directly to your mobile device. Solo even comes with The Frame from GoPro, pre-installed with vibration isolation, so you can get a beautiful HD video stream hassle-free, right out of the box. Solo has built-in computers so it can constantly monitor your flight. If you crash or lose connection, the app will prompt you to instantly create a service ticket, which you can submit instantly through your mobile device’s internet connection, wherever you’re flying.","Additional Information Drone Name Solo Quadcopter Flight Time 20min Range 1km Combo or Accessory Drones Status New Max Speed 24m/s Number of Batteries 2 Special Feature Ballistic Parachute System, Innovative Flight Computer"

Your Phantom 3 Advanced stays stable and under your control at all times during flight. After takeoff, it automatically hovers in place, waiting for your command. It then effortlessly changes altitude or direction at the flick of a finger. When you want it to stop, it again pauses and hovers, waiting for your next instruction. EASY, ASSISTED FLIGHT Flying a Phantom 3 Advanced is easy. The first time and every time. Your Phantom automatically keeps itself in the air, level and steady. Flying has never been this easy.

The Phantom 3 Advanced will automatically stop and stay inside of your chosen limits as you fly. LIVE GPS Throughout each flight, your Phantom 3 Advanced sends its position to a live GPS map on your mobile device. Use this map to see right where it is, know which direction it is facing, and guide it back to you in an instant. Because the Phantom knows where it is and where you are, it can calculate how much longer it can continue flying. It will send you a reminder to land when the battery runs low, and it can automatically come home and land when needed. WORRY-FREE, EVERY TIME When you are flying, you always know where your Phantom is, and it is always ready to come back to you.

The Phantom 3 Advanced gives you an all  new perspective of sports, parties, and family events with a built-in camera that captures sharp, vivid 2.7K HD video and 12 megapixel photos.

As the Phantom tilts and turns, the gimbal holds the camera flat and level, eliminating all unwanted shake. YOUR FLYING CAMERA Putting a camera in the sky makes everything you capture more exciting and fun to watch.

MOVIE-QUALITY STABILIZATION Keeping the camera stable and shake-free is crucial to creating beautiful images, whether on the ground or in the air.

The 3-axis gimbal that holds the camera on your Phantom 3 Advanced is evolved from the same technology found in high-end equipment that is relied on by Hollywood filmmakers and gives you stable footage every time.

The Phantom 3 Advanced gives you an all  new perspective of sports, parties, and family events with a built-in camera that captures sharp, vivid 2.7K HD video and 12 megapixel photos. Shaky photos and video can ruin even the most impressive scenes. Keeping the camera perfectly stable is a precision engineered 3-axis gimbal, giving your footage a little movie magic.

MOVIE-QUALITY STABILIZATION Keeping the camera stable and shake-free is crucial to creating beautiful images, whether on the ground or in the air.

YOUR FLYING CAMERA Putting a camera in the sky makes everything you capture more exciting and fun to watch. Take unbelievable photos, shoot videos of friends and family, and record life’s moments in ways you never thought possible. With the Phantom 3 Pro, share your aerial photos and videos instantly to your favorite social networks and amaze your friends. STUNNING PHOTOS AND VIDEO The built in camera shoots 4K video, which is almost 3 times as clear as the picture on your HD TV, at 30 frames per second and a maximum of 40 Mbps. Or record in full 1080P HD to capture every frame and never miss a moment. Photos from the Phantom 3 Pro come out in 12 megapixel JPEG or DNG RAW format that look as great printed out as they do on the screen. A 1/2.3” sensor, fast f/2.8 prime lens, and a preset focus are all optimized for aerial images that give you awe-inspiring results. CLEAN, ACCURATE IMAGES Most flying cameras suffer from a distorted, or “fisheye”, image. The Phantom 3 Pro is equipped with a custom built lens with a 94⁰ field of view that gives you a perfect image that is nearly distortion-free and a more accurate depiction of the world below. MOVIE-QUALITY STABILIZATION Keeping the camera stable and shake-free is crucial to creating beautiful images, whether on the ground or in the air. This is why a good stabilization gimbal is so important. The 3-axis gimbal that holds the camera on your Phantom 3 Pro is evolved from the same technology found in high-end equipment that is relied on by Hollywood filmmakers and gives you stable footage every time. The Phantom 3 Pro naturally banks and rolls as you fly, but the gimbal responds instantly and keeps the camera perfectly level. So your photos look sharp and your videos stay smooth, no matter how you fly. INTUITIVE, POWERFUL FLIGHT Enjoy the thrill of flight as you speed through the air. Powerful, responsive motors send your Phantom soaring exactly on the path you want. Stop in place, speed up, or fly higher in an instant. Curved DJI electromagnets are used to spin the motors at high, controllable speeds – all by using magnetic force, without any physical contact, to increase durability. Advances in efficiency and reliability push the limits of current technology and give you longer flights. ULTIMATE CONTROL Full control is in your hands with a remote controller built specifically for the Phantom 3 Pro. Precise control sticks command flight, while a dial lets you tilt the camera to see more. With a built-in rechargeable battery, a clamp to hold your mobile device, and a range extender for up to 3.5km range, this powerful remote makes flying easy and fun. FLIGHT MADE EASY A custom-built remote controller keeps your Phantom 3 Pro under your command at all times. The ergonomic design is easy to hold and lightweight, and all the controls you need are right at your fingertips. With this remote, it’s easy to fly the way you want. TILT THE CAMERA Aim the camera by using the gimbal control dial on top of the remote. Tilt it up and down to see more and frame the perfect shot. PRECISION CONTROL Easy to grip control sticks enable accurate, precise flight. Everything from minute position adjustments to full speed flying is instant and intuitive. These spring-loaded sticks automatically center when you let go, freezing the Phantom in place. So you can frame your shot, check the map, and plan your next move while it hovers and waits. LONG FLIGHTS, LONG LIFE For ease of use, a rechargeable 2600 mAh LiPo battery is integrated into the remote controller. Bright LEDs on the front tell you the remaining power at a glance, and it will beep to remind you when the power runs low. UNIQUE MOBILE APP Snap photos and record videos with just a tap thanks to a mobile app that turns your device into a camera controller, flight cockpit, and more. The DJI GO app makes you feel as though the camera is right in your hands, allowing you to see a live view, control the shutter, change settings, and access a wealth of unmissable features: Automatic video editor that helps you create a new movie in seconds User-friendly interface for controlling the camera and flight settings Live map and radar that tracks your Phantom 3 Pro as it flies Full flight telemetry including current speed, altitude, and distance Flight logs to record and remember your best moments MORE FLYING, MORE FUN Fly for up to 25 minutes on a single charge.

AUTOMATIC FLIGHT ASSISTANT Fly with absolute freedom and confidence, knowing your Phantom 3 Advanced will return to you at the press of a button. Built-in GPS records your Phantom’s takeoff point and remembers it as you fly. Then at your command, or if the control signal is ever lost, your Phantom comes back to you instantly. Your Phantom 3 Advanced stays stable and under your control at all times during flight. After takeoff, it automatically hovers in place, waiting for your command. It then effortlessly changes altitude or direction at the flick of a finger. When you want it to stop, it again pauses and hovers, waiting for your next instruction. EASY, ASSISTED FLIGHT Flying a Phantom 3 Advanced is easy. The first time and every time. Your Phantom automatically keeps itself in the air, level and steady. Flying has never been this easy. AUTO-HOVER When you stop telling it to move, the Phantom 3 Advanced hovers perfectly in place, holding both position and altitude. It waits for you to give it instructions. This means all you need to think about is where you want to fly. SAFE FLIGHT LIMITS Set height and distance limits to keep all flights within a safe area. The Phantom 3 Advanced will automatically stop and stay inside of your chosen limits as you fly. LIVE GPS Throughout each flight, your Phantom 3 Advanced sends its position to a live GPS map on your mobile device. Use this map to see right where it is, know which direction it is facing, and guide it back to you in an instant. Because the Phantom knows where it is and where you are, it can calculate how much longer it can continue flying. It will send you a reminder to land when the battery runs low, and it can automatically come home and land when needed. WORRY-FREE, EVERY TIME When you are flying, you always know where your Phantom is, and it is always ready to come back to you. With built-in Return to Home, the Phantom 3 Advanced remembers where you took off from and comes back when you are finished flying. So enjoy your flight, tap a button, and your Phantom is back in your hands, safe and secure. STATUS AND DIRECTION INDICATORS Four bright, large LED lights on each arm of the Phantom 3 Advanced light up as you fly. So at a glance, you know which direction your Phantom is facing and its current status. YOUR FLYING CAMERA Record moments that you want to remember forever, and share those moments in an unforgettable way. The Phantom 3 Advanced gives you an all  new perspective of sports, parties, and family events with a built-in camera that captures sharp, vivid 2.7K HD video and 12 megapixel photos. Shaky photos and video can ruin even the most impressive scenes. Keeping the camera perfectly stable is a precision engineered 3-axis gimbal, giving your footage a little movie magic. As the Phantom tilts and turns, the gimbal holds the camera flat and level, eliminating all unwanted shake. YOUR FLYING CAMERA Putting a camera in the sky makes everything you capture more exciting and fun to watch. Take unbelievable photos, shoot videos of friends and family, and record life’s moments in ways you never thought possible. With the Phantom 3 Advanced, share your aerial photos and videos instantly to your favorite social networks and amaze your friends. STUNNING PHOTOS AND VIDEO The built in camera shoots 2.7K video, which is almost 3 times as clear as the picture on your HD TV, at 30 frames per second and a maximum of 40 Mbps. Or record in full 1080P HD to capture every frame and never miss a moment. Photos from the Phantom 3 Advanced come out in 12 megapixel JPEG or DNG RAW format that look as great printed out as they do on the screen. A 1/2.3” sensor, fast f/2.8 prime lens, and a preset focus are all optimized for aerial images that give you awe-inspiring results. CLEAN, ACCURATE IMAGES Most flying cameras suffer from a distorted, or “fisheye”, image. The Phantom 3 Advanced is equipped with a custom built lens with a 94⁰ field of view that gives you a perfect image that is nearly distortion-free and a more accurate depiction of the world below. MOVIE-QUALITY STABILIZATION Keeping the camera stable and shake-free is crucial to creating beautiful images, whether on the ground or in the air. This is why a good stabilization gimbal is so important. The 3-axis gimbal that holds the camera on your Phantom 3 Advanced is evolved from the same technology found in high-end equipment that is relied on by Hollywood filmmakers and gives you stable footage every time. The Phantom 3 Advanced naturally banks and rolls as you fly, but the gimbal responds instantly and keeps the camera perfectly level. So your photos look sharp and your videos stay smooth, no matter how you fly. INTUITIVE, POWERFUL FLIGHT Enjoy the thrill of flight as you speed through the air. Powerful, responsive motors send your Phantom soaring exactly on the path you want. Stop in place, speed up, or fly higher in an instant. Curved DJI electromagnets are used to spin the motors at high, controllable speeds – all by using magnetic force, without any physical contact, to increase durability. Advances in efficiency and reliability push the limits of current technology and give you longer flights. ULTIMATE CONTROL Full control is in your hands with a remote controller built specifically for the Phantom 3 Standard.

ONLY 2 LEFT Phantom 3 Standard Second Hand,Phantom 3 Deals,R 7995,https://www.droneworld.co.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/20180525_114522-600x450.jpg,"Safe, easy, and fun to fly, the Phantom 3 Standard makes it possible for everyone to reach for the sky. With an intuitive flight system, built-in camera, live HD view, and more, the Phantom 3 Standard gives you everything you need to fly. Click here for more info on our drone crash protection.","Product Description Safe, easy, and fun to fly, the Phantom 3 Standard makes it possible for everyone to reach for the sky. This drone has very limited range in some instances down to just a few hundred meters, for more range choose Phantom 4 or Mavic Pro. With an intuitive flight system, built-in camera, live HD view, and more, the Phantom 3 Standard gives you everything you need to fly. AUTOMATIC FLIGHT ASSISTANT Fly with absolute freedom and confidence, knowing your Phantom 3 Standard will return to you at the press of a button. Built-in GPS records your Phantom’s takeoff point and remembers it as you fly. Then at your command, or if the control signal is ever lost, your Phantom comes back to you instantly. Your Phantom 3 Standard stays stable and under your control at all times during flight. After takeoff, it automatically hovers in place, waiting for your command. It then effortlessly changes altitude or direction at the flick of a finger. When you want it to stop, it again pauses and hovers, waiting for your next instruction. EASY, ASSISTED FLIGHT Flying a Phantom 3 Standard is easy. The first time and every time. Your Phantom automatically keeps itself in the air, level and steady. Flying has never been this easy. AUTO-HOVER When you stop telling it to move, the Phantom 3 Standard hovers perfectly in place, holding both position and altitude. It waits for you to give it instructions. This means all you need to think about is where you want to fly. SAFE FLIGHT LIMITS Set height and distance limits to keep all flights within a safe area. The Phantom 3 Standard will automatically stop and stay inside of your chosen limits as you fly. LIVE GPS Throughout each flight, your Phantom 3 Standard sends its position to a live GPS map on your mobile device. Use this map to see right where it is, know which direction it is facing, and guide it back to you in an instant. Because the Phantom knows where it is and where you are, it can calculate how much longer it can continue flying. It will send you a reminder to land when the battery runs low, and it can automatically come home and land when needed. WORRY-FREE, EVERY TIME When you are flying, you always know where your Phantom is, and it is always ready to come back to you. With built-in Return to Home, the Phantom 3 Standard remembers where you took off from and comes back when you are finished flying. So enjoy your flight, tap a button, and your Phantom is back in your hands, safe and secure. STATUS AND DIRECTION INDICATORS Four bright, large LED lights on each arm of the Phantom 3 Standard light up as you fly. So at a glance, you know which direction your Phantom is facing and its current status. YOUR FLYING CAMERA Record moments that you want to remember forever, and share those moments in an unforgettable way. The Phantom 3 Standard gives you an all  new perspective of sports, parties, and family events with a built-in camera that captures sharp, vivid 2.7K HD video and 12 megapixel photos. Shaky photos and video can ruin even the most impressive scenes. Keeping the camera perfectly stable is a precision engineered 3-axis gimbal, giving your footage a little movie magic. As the Phantom tilts and turns, the gimbal holds the camera flat and level, eliminating all unwanted shake. YOUR FLYING CAMERA Putting a camera in the sky makes everything you capture more exciting and fun to watch. Take unbelievable photos, shoot videos of friends and family, and record life’s moments in ways you never thought possible. With the Phantom 3 Standard, share your aerial photos and videos instantly to your favorite social networks and amaze your friends. STUNNING PHOTOS AND VIDEO The built in camera shoots 2.7K video, which is almost 3 times as clear as the picture on your HD TV, at 30 frames per second and a maximum of 40 Mbps. Or record in full 1080P HD to capture every frame and never miss a moment. Photos from the Phantom 3 Standard come out in 12 megapixel JPEG or DNG RAW format that look as great printed out as they do on the screen. A 1/2.3” sensor, fast f/2.8 prime lens, and a preset focus are all optimized for aerial images that give you awe-inspiring results. CLEAN, ACCURATE IMAGES Most flying cameras suffer from a distorted, or “fisheye”, image. The Phantom 3 Standard is equipped with a custom built lens with a 94⁰ field of view that gives you a perfect image that is nearly distortion-free and a more accurate depiction of the world below. MOVIE-QUALITY STABILIZATION Keeping the camera stable and shake-free is crucial to creating beautiful images, whether on the ground or in the air. This is why a good stabilization gimbal is so important. The 3-axis gimbal that holds the camera on your Phantom 3 Standard is evolved from the same technology found in high-end equipment that is relied on by Hollywood filmmakers and gives you stable footage every time. The Phantom 3 standard naturally banks and rolls as you fly, but the gimbal responds instantly and keeps the camera perfectly level. So your photos look sharp and your videos stay smooth, no matter how you fly. INTUITIVE, POWERFUL FLIGHT Enjoy the thrill of flight as you speed through the air. Powerful, responsive motors send your Phantom soaring exactly on the path you want. Stop in place, speed up, or fly higher in an instant. Curved DJI electromagnets are used to spin the motors at high, controllable speeds – all by using magnetic force, without any physical contact, to increase durability. Advances in efficiency and reliability push the limits of current technology and give you longer flights. ULTIMATE CONTROL Full control is in your hands with a remote controller built specifically for the Phantom 3 Standard. Precise control sticks command flight, while a dial lets you tilt the camera to see more. With a built-in rechargeable battery, a clamp to hold your mobile device, and a range extender for up to 0.62 mile (1km) range, this powerful remote makes flying easy and fun. FLIGHT MADE EASY A custom-built remote controller keeps your Phantom 3 Standard under your command at all times. The ergonomic design is easy to hold and lightweight, and all the controls you need are right at your fingertips. With this remote, it’s easy to fly the way you want. TILT THE CAMERA Aim the camera by using the gimbal control dial on top of the remote. Tilt it up and down to see more and frame the perfect shot. PRECISION CONTROL Easy to grip control sticks enable accurate, precise flight. Everything from minute position adjustments to full speed flying is instant and intuitive. These spring-loaded sticks automatically center when you let go, freezing the Phantom in place. So you can frame your shot, check the map, and plan your next move while it hovers and waits. BUILT-IN WIFI Linking your mobile device to your Phantom through the DJI GO app is easy with an enhanced WiFi range extender that’s built right into the remote controller. Connect to the Phantom’s WiFi network to see a live view, access advanced camera controls, and more. LONG FLIGHTS, LONG LIFE For ease of use, a rechargeable 2600 mAh LiPo battery is integrated into the remote controller. Bright LEDs on the front tell you the remaining power at a glance, and it will beep to remind you when the power runs low. The remote is easily recharged by USB, no matter where you are. UNIQUE MOBILE APP Snap photos and record videos with just a tap thanks to a mobile app that turns your device into a camera controller, flight cockpit, and more. The DJI GO app makes you feel as though the camera is right in your hands, allowing you to see a live view, control the shutter, change settings, and access a wealth of unmissable features: Automatic video editor that helps you create a new movie in seconds User-friendly interface for controlling the camera and flight settings Live map and radar that tracks your Phantom 3 Standard as it flies Full flight telemetry including current speed, altitude, and distance Flight logs to record and remember your best moments MORE FLYING, MORE FUN Fly for up to 25 minutes on a single charge.

This information is streamed live to the GO app on your mobile device. Recharging is quick and easy, and bright LED indicators tell you current status and power level. A protective plastic housing helps prevent damage and contains intelligent sensors that make your battery worry-free while extending the life of your battery. DJI GO APP Free to download and use with your Phantom 3 Standard, the DJI GO app puts complete control in your hands.

Applications: With the same powerful thermal imaging core used in the most popular cameras in the world, FLIR Tau2 provides the same performance for a ground breaking low price, making it perfect for applications like: Search and rescue Precision agriculture Roof inspections Power line inspections Substation inspections Cell tower inspections Security Surveying And anything else you can dream up Included: Flir VUE PRO 336 thermal camera DRONEWORLD FLIR gimbal for stabilised thermal video with integrated video transmitter DRONEWORLD controller with touch LCD for controlling the thermal camera remotely (tilt, digital zoom, palettes, isotherm, delta-t) 7″ LCD with 5.8 FPV diversity receiver Assembling (complete ready to fly) Tablet or Smart Device not included FAQ: Q: What is the main difference between the FLIR TAU2 and FLIR VUE camera: A: The cameras have some differences, but the biggest difference is that the TAU2 is radiometric (14 bit), and therefore you are able to remotely control the isotherm and delta-t. On the VUE camera you can control the tilt, palettes and digital zoom, on the TAU2 you can control the tilt, palettes, digital zoom, isotherm and delta-t. In most professional applications this might be needed. Q:What can you do with radiometric Isotherm and Delta-t: A: Delta-t and Isotherm is a good feature to have within professional application. This is best explained with an example: when you do ‘search and rescue’ (SAR human detection) you can set the Isotherm on (for example) 36 degree and set delta-t on 1 degree. Temperatures on 36 degree will be highlighted very strong descending to 35 and 37 (1 degree Delta-t), so 35 degree will be little less highlighted then 36 degree. This way you can specify an window temperature which make spotting this temp easier.","Additional Information Special Feature Farming Solutions, New, Security Solutions, Thermal Solutions"

INCLUDES Assembly! Product Description: Inspire 1 V2 with thermal FLIR Vue Pro 336 thermal camera for operations as diverse as industrial inspection, solar panel inspection, search and rescue and pipeline surveys This package is ready-to-fly, including the Inspire. The package is provided with the thermalFLIR Vue Pro 336 camera (FLIR is the most popular brand worldwide in thermal imaging) Dual screen: Watch daylight and thermal view simultaneously on two screens. This setup is provided with an additional Droneworld LCD touch controller, for controlling the thermalFLIR Vue Pro 336 camera (tilting, digital zoom, palettes, isotherm, delta-t). You are able to control the FLIR camera/gimbal separately.

On the VUE camera you can control the tilt, palettes and digital zoom, on the TAU2 you can control the tilt, palettes, digital zoom, isotherm and delta-t. In most professional applications this might be needed. Q:What can you do with radiometric Isotherm and Delta-t: A: Delta-t and Isotherm is a good feature to have within professional application. This is best explained with an example: when you do ‘search and rescue’ (SAR human detection) you can set the Isotherm on (for example) 36 degree and set delta-t on 1 degree. Temperatures on 36 degree will be highlighted very strong descending to 35 and 37 (1 degree Delta-t), so 35 degree will be little less highlighted then 36 degree. This way you can specify an window temperature which make spotting this temp easier. Q: Can i also buy the package for installation on my own Inspire: A: Yes, no problem, we also offer the gimbal package + FLIR camera with instruction for installation on your own Drone!
